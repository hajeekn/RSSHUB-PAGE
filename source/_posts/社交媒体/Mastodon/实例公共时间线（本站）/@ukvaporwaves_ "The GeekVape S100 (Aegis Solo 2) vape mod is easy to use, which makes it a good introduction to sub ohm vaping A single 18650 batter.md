<hr><p>The GeekVape S100 (Aegis Solo 2) vape mod is easy to use, which makes it a good introduction to sub ohm vaping. A single 18650 battery (sold separately) is needed to power its 5 - 100W output range. This wattage range means that the S100 is capable of supporting either an MTL (Mouth To Lung) or DTL (Direct To Lung) vape style with a wide range of tanks. Beyond that, with its water, dust and shock resistant build, you can feel confident taking it with you on the go.<br><a href="https://ukvaporwaves.com/geekvape-s100-aegis-solo-2-mod.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ukvaporwaves.com/geekvape-s100-aegis-solo-2-mod.html</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/042/859/351/original/2be981d47d408595.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
