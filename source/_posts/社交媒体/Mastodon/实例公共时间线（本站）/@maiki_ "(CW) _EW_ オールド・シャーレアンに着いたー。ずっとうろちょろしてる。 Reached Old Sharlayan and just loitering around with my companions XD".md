[EW] オールド・シャーレアンに着いたー。ずっとうろちょろしてる。 Reached Old Sharlayan and just loitering around with my companions XD<hr><p>It's so nice to walk around with Graha~~~ I especially love the roadside book shops and Graha having the urge to check them out is totally a mood 😂 I reached at night time too so the view is so nice!! And once I reached the top it was snowing too!! So happy to be in another area that snows!!<br>The only clear snowy photo I have is the one that has Yviy-kun gomen ne ww</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/040/575/532/original/a04c838ad1b48b83.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/040/575/535/original/d22b12dae60be3b9.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/040/575/565/original/f3acea77617c7148.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
