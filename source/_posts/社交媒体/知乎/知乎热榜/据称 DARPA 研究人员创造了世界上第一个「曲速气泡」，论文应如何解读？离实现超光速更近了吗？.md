ReversedT的回答<br><br><p data-pid="48tiw6M4">太长不看版：不是真的。</p><hr><p data-pid="tIH6ECQr">想看长的版：</p><p data-pid="VddHgX5p">看看文章摘要就行了，不用看很长——</p><blockquote data-pid="lq7tSl5I">While conducting analysis related to a DARPA-funded project to evaluate possible structure of the energy density present in a Casimir cavity as predicted by the dynamic vacuum model, a micro/nano-scale structure has been discovered that <b>predicts</b> negative energy density distribution that closely matches requirements for the Alcubierre metric. The simplest notional geometry being analyzed as part of the DARPA-funded work consists of a standard parallel plate Casimir cavity equipped with pillars arrayed along the cavity mid-plane with the purpose of detecting a transient electric field arising from vacuum polarization conjectured to occur along the midplane of the cavity. An analytic technique called worldline numerics was adapted to numerically assess vacuum response to the custom Casimir cavity, and these numerical analysis results were observed to be qualitatively quite similar to a two-dimensional representation of energy density requirements for the Alcubierre warp metric. Subsequently, a toy model consisting of a 1 µm diameter sphere centrally located in a 4µm diameter cylinder was analyzed to show a three-dimensional Casimir energy density that correlates well with the Alcubierre warp metric requirements. This qualitative correlation would suggest that chip-scale experiments <b>might be explored to attempt to measure tiny signatures</b> illustrative of the presence of the conjectured phenomenon: a real, albeit humble, warp bubble.</blockquote><hr><p data-pid="CgiXqeON">想看长的但是又看不下去的太长不看版：</p><p data-pid="t8KUIJkx">研究者们用一种改进的数值分析方法跑了一些模拟，发现在某种特定的微结构下可以跑出负的能量密度分布，看着有点像阿库别瑞度规需要的那种负能量。研究者们建议（要不再给点钱）咱试试造个真的，也许就真的看到曲速泡了。</p><p data-pid="PIcmzBZX">然后写文章的媒体就看到上面的最后半句话：“真的看到曲速泡了。”</p><hr><p data-pid="SAGUnN5c">突然发现原问题里引用了报道文章的这样两段话：</p><blockquote data-pid="jTGS_QrP">Warp drive pioneer and former NASA warp drive specialist <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.limitlessspace.org/sonny-white/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dr. Harold G "Sonny" White</a>  has reported the successful manifestation of an actual, real-world "Warp Bubble." And, according to White, this first of its kind breakthrough by his <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.limitlessspace.org/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Limitless Space Institute</a> (LSI) team sets a new starting point for those trying to manufacture a full-sized, warp-capable spacecraft.<br>"To be clear, our finding is not a warp bubble analog, it is a real, albeit humble and tiny, warp bubble," White told <i>The Debrief</i>, quickly dispensing with the notion that this is anything other than the creation of an actual, real-world warp bubble. "Hence the  significance."<br></blockquote><p data-pid="5p1oO87c">光看这两段话，似乎 White 的团队是真的造出了一个曲速泡。</p><p data-pid="Jke4sFDM">但其实这两段话中间还有一段：</p><blockquote data-pid="lxXQ6J8V">In an interview, White added that "our detailed numerical analysis of  our custom Casimir cavities helped us identify a real and manufacturable nano/microstructure that is predicted to generate a negative vacuum energy density such that it would manifest a real nanoscale warp bubble, not an analog, but the real thing." In other words, a warp bubble structure will manifest under these specific conditions. White cautioned that this does not mean we are near building a fully functioning warp drive, as much more science needs to be done <i>(Updated 08/12/21).</i></blockquote><p data-pid="Iy_-mL0z">这段话明确地表达了这是一个“可以制造出的微纳结构，预期它会产生一个负真空能密度的、真正的曲速泡”。里面反复强调的 real thing 指的并不是他们真的造了出来，而是说这个曲速泡（如果观察到了的话）是真的，不是某种近似模拟（举个例子，很多研究会用声子的行为来近似模拟一些难以制造和观测的量子现象，因为它们服从形式相同的方程。这里强调的是这个实验如果能做成的话，做出来的结果是真的曲速泡。）</p>
