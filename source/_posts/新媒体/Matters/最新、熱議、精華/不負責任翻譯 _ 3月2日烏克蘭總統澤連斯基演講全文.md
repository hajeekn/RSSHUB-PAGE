I did not accidentally say “united”. The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time, we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first, we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now, we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other.</p><p>各位團結的國民，你們好。我是特意說「團結」的。這場恐怖的戰爭已經打到第七日。這是一場同仇敵愾的戰爭。在這七日，我們比過去三十年還要團結。開戰之初，我們感受相同的害怕、相同的痛苦。直至今天，我們已經拋下所有，除了勝利、真理、和平！除了我們所渴望的平靜！除了我們所擔心的親友！除了烏克蘭！這段時間，我們真正成為一體。我們忘記彼此的嫌隙。我們開始愛人如己，互相幫助。我們為彼此擔憂。</p><p>Yesterday morning on Freedom Square, We were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. We all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises consistently - never again.</p><p>昨天早上在自由廣場，我們曾是哈爾科夫的居民，敵人在破壞博羅江卡的住宅樓宇之時，已把我們全部殺死。昨晚，我們被攻擊基輔的炸彈所轟炸；我們全都再被襲擊巴賓亞爾的導彈殺死。雖然全世界一再保證這些攻擊不會再發生。</p><p>For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundreds thousands people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries.Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there, and also a sports complex, outbuildings. They built a park there to erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity! Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history. But they have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.</p><p>正常認識歷史的人都應該知道，巴賓亞爾是基輔之傷，也是歐洲之傷。這是祈禱之地，是一個記念成千上萬被納粹軍屠殺的人，是一個舊基輔的墓園。究竟心腸要多麼惡毒的人才會以這地方作目標？你們又再次殺死納粹大屠殺的死者！在蘇聯時期，他們在那裡的骨頭上建起了一座電視中心，還有一個附屬的運動場館。他們建了一個公園試圖抹去巴賓雅爾的真實歷史。但為何要被炸？這是完全沒有人性的! 如此密集的導彈攻擊，表明了我們的基輔對很多俄國人是完全陌生。他們完全不認識我們的首都，不認識我們的歷史。但，他們仍要抺去我們的歷史、抺去我們的國家、抺去我們所有人。</p><p>On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed. Where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then, Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world : Don’t you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now : Nazism is born in silence.</p><p>戰爭的第一天，烏曼遭到慘烈轟炸。這裡每年有數十萬猶太人前來祈禱；然後，巴賓亞爾是數十萬猶太人被處決的地方。我現在對世界上所有的猶太人講話：「你沒看到發生了什麼嗎？」這是為什麼全世界數百萬猶太人現在不要再保持沉默的非常重要原因：納粹主義在沉默中誕生。</p><p>So shout about the killings of civilians, shout about the killings of Ukrainians. Last night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs, missiles, artillery, machine guns targeting peaceful people again.Mariupol,Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and the otherc ites and towns of Ukraine.This cannot be explained by any human reason, any reason of God.</p><p>他們大聲喊殺平民，殺死烏克蘭人。昨晚和今晚，他們不斷轟炸我們的城市。炸彈、導彈、砲兵、機關槍再次瞄準在馬里烏波爾、哈爾科夫、基輔、日托米爾及烏克蘭的其他城市和城鎮裡和平的人。這些殺戮不能用任何人類的理由解釋，包括是任何的天意。</p><p>What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew’s Church? Whatever they dream of there – damn them!</p><p>如果巴賓亞爾遭到襲擊怎麼辦？還有哪些軍事設施威脅俄羅斯？還有哪些“北約基地”？聖索菲亞大教堂？拉夫拉？聖安德魯教堂？他們想攻擊哪裡就攻擊哪裡，該死的！</p><p>Because God is with us ! During this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people, millions and millions of Europeans, from the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. our unity.</p><p>上帝與我們同在！這段時間我們團結歐盟到達一個新程度，是超越官方及地域的。我們團結的是，從大西洋到仍在繼續激烈戰鬥的哈爾科夫郊區數以百萬計的歐洲平民。當歐洲議會為我們站立，為我們的抵抗而拍手。這是對我們的努力及團結的肯定。</p><p>Six days of war are like thirty years. This is why the European Union answers “yes” to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So, what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can’t stay neutral right now!</p><p>戰事六日，如像人間三十年。因此，歐盟終於對我們的申請表示「yes」。我們將會進行特快的處理程序。我們的外交官和我們的朋友為了烏克蘭和和平而團結世界。中立的瑞士也加入制裁俄羅斯的權貴、官員、州份及公司。請容許我重覆：是中立的瑞士！其他國家呢？一星期前莫斯科所依賴的國家，今日也加入反戰聯盟。這是令人振奮的成果！你不能獨善其身，繼續保持中立。</p><p>And what is the result for Russia? The flag of the state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country.</p><p>如今俄羅斯的情況呢？體育比賽再也見不到俄國的旗幟；現代世界的文化大門向他們緊閉鎖上；俄國的貨物已開始從世界下架；俄國銀行從國際系統中剔除；俄國人民正在失去他們辛苦的積蓄，喪失所有的財富；俄國母親不會再見到她們在異鄉的孩子。</p><p>Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them.</p><p>請想想六千這數字。這是俄軍被殺的數字，是俄國軍隊在六日中所失去的生命，還未計算昨夜逝去的生命。這整整六千條人命！到底為了什麼？為了搶奪烏克蘭？這是不可能的幻想！任憑導彈再多，炸彈再強，也奪不去烏克蘭。我們已在祖國的土地上。這土地的入侵者將會被送上國際法庭。</p><p>Ukrainians! Another night of Russia’s full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in a basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We have hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously.</p><p>親愛的烏克蘭人，我們又撐過了俄軍傾全國之力的襲擊。這是不容易的一晚。有的在防空洞渡過這長夜；有的在地牢；有些比較幸運的可以留在家中；亦有人得到親友相助，借宿一宵。但過去七夜我們都徹夜難眠；或幸入夢鄉，卻又轉輾反側。</p><p>My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need, which we have always appreciated, and which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you from Hollywood stars to politicians. Thank you. Ukrainians are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment. Glory to Ukraine.</p><p>親愛的烏克蘭國民，當時間到，我們定可再次安枕。但要等待戰事結束，要等待勝利的來臨。我們時常感恩曾經身處在和平的國度，也從未摧毀過它，因為這正是我們所需要。我懇請你們互相照顧所愛的人。互相照顧軍中兄弟。我以你們為榮，由荷里活大明星到各國政要，全世界也以你們為榮，也以你們為榜樣。多謝你們。烏克蘭人是無畏無懼的象徵。你們象徵著在任何一個國家、在任何時候都可以成為最好的人。願光榮歸於烏克蘭!</p>
