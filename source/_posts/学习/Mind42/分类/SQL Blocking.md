                    When one session holds a lock on a specific resource and a second SPID attempts to acquire a conflicting lock type on the same resource, blocking occurs. This SQL Blocking slows down programmes and is a concern for multi-threaded systems such as distributed computing. This is a standard data warehouse stalemate. Data cannot be entered into the system until the lock is released, and there is no way to access transactions without releasing locks and tune your applications for optimal resource utilization.
