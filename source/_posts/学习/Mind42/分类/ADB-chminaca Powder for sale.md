                    AB-CHMINACA (Item No. 15434) is an indazole-based synthetic cannabinoid (CB) that is structurally related to AB-FUBINACA, a high affinity ligand of the CB1 receptor (Ki = 0.9 nM).1,2 MAB-CHMINACA is structurally similar to AB-CHMINACA by bearing an identical cyclohexyl group; however, the isobutyl moiety is substituted with a tert-butyl group. It is a potent agonist of the CB1 receptor with a reported Ki value of 0.289 nM.2 This product is intended for forensic and research applications.                </p>
