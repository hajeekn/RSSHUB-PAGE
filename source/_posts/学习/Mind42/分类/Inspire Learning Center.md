                    We are an independently owned childcare center that has curriculum geared toward Kindergarten readiness. It engages children in hands-on learning activities that encourage them to explore and solve problems at their own rate of development. This forms a foundation for kids to Learn, Play and Grow under the care of our nurturing teachers and staff.                </p>
