                    While currency trading can help you generate lucrative returns, it is also a high risk investment opportunity. Things get even more difficult when you trade in a country like India. There are regulatory restrictions and Indian traders have limited options for trading. Currency derivatives help in mitigating the risk associated with the currency fluctuations. These are alternative sources of investment for investors which if & when done systematically can help earn well in the long run.                </p>
