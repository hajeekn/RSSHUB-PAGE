                    colorful lighting was typically limited to theatre and performance applications. However as LED technology made significant leaps during that time, the realm of possibilities has since expanded to commercial, architectural and even domestic applications. As a result it is now common to see colorful lighting installations outside of entertainment districts and in areas where previously it was not feasible.                </p>
