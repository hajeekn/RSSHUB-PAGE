                    This mind map provides an overview of the possible promotion outlets for an open data competition. It is intended to be built upon and used as part of a promotion strategy. It also provides examples from the LinkedUp Challenge, a series of competitions organised as part of the LinkedUp Project. The LinkedUp Project aims to push forward the exploitation of the vast amounts of public, open data available on the Web, in particular by educational institutions and organizations.                </p>
