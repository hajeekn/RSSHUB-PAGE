                    2-FDCK 2-Fl-2′-Oxo-PCM (also known as 2-Fluorodeschloroketamine, 2-FDCK, and inaccurately as 2-Fluroketamine, Fluoroketamine, and 2-FK) is a lesser-known novel dissociative substance of the arylcyclohexylamine class that produces dissociative, anesthetic, and hallucinogenic effects when administered. It is structurally related to arylcyclohexylamines like ketamine and deschloroketamine and is reported to produce similar effects.                </p>
