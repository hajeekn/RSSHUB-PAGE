                    Computing the average acceleration and velocity formula is a simple physics experiment anyone can do. All one needs to do is take measurements of the same quantity at two recorded times, take the difference between those two measurements, and divide by the difference between the two times. In this course, you will learn the difference between the instantaneous rate of change and the average rate of change. You will learn how the definition of average velocity and average acceleration as well as how to compute each. Examples of a car driving on a freeway and taking a look at the speedometer or odometer reading two separate times are presented to make the concepts relatable.                </p>
