                    A visit to the Microsoft surface studio servicing facility in Dubai is the ideal solution if your surface studio is lagging and making it difficult to manage faster. All Microsoft workstations can have their RAM upgraded at a service centre, which you can pay for. In most circumstances, repairing the Ram is not an option, thus you'll have to replace it. The repair companies are well-versed in replacing Ram at a low cost.                </p>
