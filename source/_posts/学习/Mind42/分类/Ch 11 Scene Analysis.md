                    An outline of chapter 11 from Robert McKee's book "Story." This was one of the most important and helpful chapters for me in understanding how to judge my work and how to construct a story block by block (or rather beat by beat). I wanted to create a document to access when I don't have the book on me. I'll continue to build on it and outline how scenes lead to acts.                </p>
