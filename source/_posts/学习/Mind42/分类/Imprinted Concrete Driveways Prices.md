                    Pattern Imprinted Concrete is an extremely revolutionary procedure for stamping the surface of newly poured ready mixed concrete to simulate the appearance of cobbles, brick, slate, tile or stone. A specially developed, higher strength, fibre entrained concrete mix is poured on site, before a dry shake colour hardener is then floated into the surface. The concrete is after that imprinted with specifically created textured mats to give an individual and beautiful look.                </p>
