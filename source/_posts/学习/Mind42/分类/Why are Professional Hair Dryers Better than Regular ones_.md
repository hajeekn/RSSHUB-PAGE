                    Salons can do wonders to your hair after you have had a haircut. You will later find it extremely difficult to style your hair exactly that way. Well, it is because saloons use professional hair dryers that work great for all kinds of styling and also give your hair better shine and protection. A regular dryer barely works towards drying your hair leaving it moistureless and frizzy.                </p>
