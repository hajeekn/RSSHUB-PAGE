                    Leaky roofs are annoying and cause many different problems. A leak can cause dampness and mold, which can affect your structural integrity as well as your health. Water leaks can also get into your electrical system and cause fire hazards. Professional roof inspections are a great way to identify potential problems before they become more serious.                </p>
