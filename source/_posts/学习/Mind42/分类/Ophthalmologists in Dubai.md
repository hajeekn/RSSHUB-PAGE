                    So what is the recommended course of action in current situations? For instance, if your eyesight is 20/20, why would you wear eyeglasses? Professor Baryam suggests wearing goggles or sunglasses as an additional preventive measure in light of research. As wearing glasses protects your eyes from atmospheric factors like dust and pollution, ophthalmologists in Dubai also suggest using sunshades while out for work.                </p>
