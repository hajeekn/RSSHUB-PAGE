                    Bacillus coagulans is a kind of bacteria and spore probiotic having many benefits. It produces lactic acid, however, it differs from Lactobacillus which is another probiotic. The bacteria can generate spores while it is in its reproductive life cycle. Amazingly, this bacteria is robust and can withstand harsh environments.                </p>
