                    Animal Crossing New Horizons Items with Eznpc can be acquired from Chests, Supply Drops, flooring loot, fishing & trade with players. It's feasible to offer items with the shop's dropbox. This little wood box is situated merely outside the shop's door, and also utilizing it to market stuff is as very easy as chucking it in and also enjoying the Bells wrack up.                </p>
