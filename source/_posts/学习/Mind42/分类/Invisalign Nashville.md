                    Dr. Hall has extensive training and experience with treating patients with Invisalign. Although Invisalign may not seem as powerful as braces to help move teeth and obtain bite correction, Dr. Hall has the expertise to be able to predictably treat cases that would have required braces in the past. Invisalign offers a modern approach to straightening teeth with a custom made series of aligners designed just for you. These aligner trays are virtually invisible and made of smooth comfortable material that you wear over your teeth.https://mhallortho.com/treatments/types-of-treatments/invisalign                </p>
