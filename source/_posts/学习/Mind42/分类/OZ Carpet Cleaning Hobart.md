                    Before a professional team starts cleaning your carpets here is a checklist that you should follow for sure. Your room should be empty on the day of the appointment. Also, try to remove as much furniture as you can. Don't forget to remove all the small and breakable items from the room. Never let the pets enter the room where cleaning is being performed. After this, you have to wait for your carpets to be restored back to its original glory. Finally, at the end, enjoy the comfort and fragrance of cleaned carpets.
