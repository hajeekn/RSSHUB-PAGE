                    Creating a successful small business is a dream for many people. However, it is no easy undertaking. When we first created Cards for Causes with the goal of raising $1 million for charity selling holiday and  business greeting cards, we were far from certain we would reach our goal. Fortunately, we received some great advice along the way.                </p>
