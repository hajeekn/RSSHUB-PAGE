                    There is no privilege of request against the refusal of an application for passage leeway as a Family Visitor. Anyway, there is not something to be stressed over as the refusal can even now be tested by method a Judicial Review in the Upper Tribunal of the Asylum and Migration Chamber. After that procedure, maybe you got family visitor visa UK.                </p>
