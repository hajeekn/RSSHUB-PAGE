                    Russian bride’s dot com is part of a larger network called Anastasiadate.com or Anastasia international. The thing to understand with all of these mail order bride sites is that. They have to work hard in order to protect both parties. If one party example the Russian women turns out to be a scam artist Anastasia international can be held liable also on the flip side of the coin.                </p>
