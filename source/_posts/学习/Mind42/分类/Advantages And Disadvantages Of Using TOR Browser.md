                    TOR (The Onion Router) is an open-source and free browser just like other web browsers available in the market. However, the main feature of this browser is that it helps you hide your IP (Internet Protocol) address while browsing various websites. Therefore, you can easily use the interest as an anonymous user.                </p>
