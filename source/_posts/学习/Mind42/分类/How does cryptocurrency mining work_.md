                    Bitcoin mining is the process of putting new bitcoins into circulation; it's also how the network confirms new transactions, and it's an important part of the blockchain ledger's upkeep and development. "Mining" is done with high-tech hardware that solves a very difficult computational arithmetic problem. The next block of bitcoins is granted to the first computer to solve the challenge, and the process repeats itself.                </p>
