                    We have purposefully referred to customer personnel as "Members." They are a member of our group. They should (and will) be handled accordingly. Each member is assigned a personal GO Salary contact. As a result, there will be no contact centre, no email 'bucket,' and no offshore data processing. We like old-fashioned, personalised service. That is what distinguishes us. Processing. That is what suffocates any service. And it adds nothing to the equation. So we got rid of it! Your workers can create their own compensation package in minutes, but even more impressively, they can administer their own salary package online 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is a genuinely interactive salary packing experience that is fully compatible with phone, tablet, and desktop.                </p>
