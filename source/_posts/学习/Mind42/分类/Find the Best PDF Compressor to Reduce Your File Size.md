                    For this, you would be needing compressing software. You can easily find many applications and websites that compress the file. But the problem with them is that they are not as effective as they promise to be. The file size before and after the compression is not much altered but the quality of the file is certainly rendered poor. If you are looking for a quality PDF compressor, then you should go for OnlyPDF. They are a free and open-to-all website where you will find all the necessary tools to get your job done.                </p>
