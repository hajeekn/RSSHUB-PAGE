                    Among medical claim audit companies, TFG Partners is a recognized leader. We audit all benefit plans that are self-funded by mid-and large-size corporations with unmatched accuracy. Our claim audits follow a 100-percent review method and are superior to random samples. We help clients comply with government regulations, including ERISA and Sarbanes-Oxley, and state audit regulations for nonprofit entities' self-funded plans. Our medical claim reviews include audit, analysis, recovery, and future planning – to prevent errors from repeating. Our goal is to help plans be better managed in all ways.When you work with us at TFG Partners on facility claims auditing, you'll be impressed by the time we'll save you and the attention we pay to detail. Because the review 100-percent of claims, our health plan audits are industry leaders. They are budget neutral and often help correct errors and recover funds that are far more than our service's cost. Wise companies also engage us for continuous claim monitoring after an audit to report mistakes and flag suspicious payments in real-time. When we're working continuously in the background, you always have access to current details about claim payments.Not many full-service benefits auditing firms can match TFG Partners' record of innovation. We revolutionized the claim audit industry in the 1990s when we harnessed software advances to review 100-percent of claims. Ever since, we've continued to improve and perfect our methods so that by today we offer clients a level of accuracy that's unrivaled. We also reduce the workload of in-house plan managers and provide them with precise and current data for oversight of claim administrators. If you're looking for a company to audit your self-funded benefits plans, TFG Partners is an excellent choice.                </p>
