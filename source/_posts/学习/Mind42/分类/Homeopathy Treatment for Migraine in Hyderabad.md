                    Migraines are best treated with homoeopathic constitutional treatment. After a thorough examination of the patient's physical and mental health status, as well as the family history, the root cause of the problem is identified with this treatment procedure. Homeopathy with a constitution ensures that the treatment is free of side effects.                </p>
