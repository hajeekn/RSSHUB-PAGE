                    Acholi Resilience, a registered Community-Based provider (in Uganda) primarily in Northern Uganda, is responding to the challenges posed by decades of struggle and violence in Acholiland. Our organization believes the Acholi people are the agents for change and are responsible for their own development. Acholi's ability and willingness to act on social injustice and poverty is what will change Acholiland.                </p>
