                    Wilderness is not a luxury but it helps humans to grow mentally as well as physically. Trails Carolina offers a premier wilderness therapy program for young adults. Our procedures combine the wilderness environment with traditional treatments. Our specialized adventure-based programs for teens are based on their personal profiles and requirements. During the program, learners live 24/7 in nature with other learners and our supportive field team. For more detail call us or visit our website.                </p>
