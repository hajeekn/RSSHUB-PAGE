                    As explained by the Drug crime lawyers in Dubai, higher penalties are imposed on anyone who has induced or incited another person to commit any offences slated under the purview of the narcotics law. For ex-pats, along with the penalty, a deportation order will also be imposed along with a permanent travel ban restricting their entry into the UAE permanently.                </p>
