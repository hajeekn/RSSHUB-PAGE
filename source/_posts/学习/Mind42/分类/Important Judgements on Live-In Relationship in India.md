                    The Indian society has observed a drastic change in its living pattern in the past few years.People are slowly and gradually opening their minds towards the idea of pre-marital intimacy and live-in relationships.However,this change has been continuously criticised as such concepts lack legality and acceptance by the society.                </p>
